# Project VOLPAROSSA Code

**OpenCode tools. VOLPAROSSA intelligence. Cooperative development.**

VOLPAROSSA Code connects the open-source **OpenCode** coding runtime to the
VOLPAROSSA core. The goal is a network-native assistant that can read, change
and check code, distribute useful work, combine agent results and improve its
working methods—without making the power of one device the limit.

OpenCode replaces the earlier Codex CLI/app-server foundation. Suitable upstream
apps, clients and editor integrations can share the same core connection. The
first integration is a development extension for VS Code/VSCodium on Linux;
cross-platform applications and packaging are not yet complete.

This README describes the OpenCode development integration, not a completed
coding assistant. Original integration code is GPL-3.0-only; upstream licenses
and notices remain intact. This is not an OpenAI-backed service or a copy of
its proprietary IDE extension.

## One coordinator, multiple cooperating agents

```

This is the **target architecture**, not a claim that every arrow works today.
Network cooperation and collective improvement are the default design, including
private projects. Core owns peer scheduling; OpenCode's local subagents do not
themselves provide a decentralized network or confidential remote execution.

Privacy belongs inside cooperation. Private work must also be able to use suitable
network executors without exposing source or tool data to their operators. That
protected execution is **not implemented by the current local executor**: TLS,
task fragmentation and peer signatures alone do not hide inputs from an ordinary
executing host. Explicitly public task sharing is a separate capability, not proof
of private distributed coding. Code, prompts, tool output and history are not
automatically public cache or training data. A local-only assistant does not
fulfill the goal of the shared VOLPAROSSA brain.

## Current executable integration

**VOLPAROSSA: Run OpenCode Task (Development)** selects the new OpenCode launcher,
not Codex. It joins these implemented components:

- Pinned OpenCode **v1.18.34**, authenticated HTTP sessions and SSE events.
- A Chat Completions provider translating text and function-tool history into
  the core's typed conversation interface.
- One-shot command/edit approvals, correlated root and child sessions,
  cancellation, session deletion and owned-process cleanup.
- An explicit Linux launcher with a selected writable project, temporary state,
  no inherited account credentials and no external network interface.

**Current proof:** the pinned OpenCode source builds and the actual runtime
completes a tool loop through the production launcher and adapters: one approved
command changes a disposable file, its tool result returns to the core interface,
and the session shuts down cleanly. A second native trial invokes the cooperative
tool, preserves complete and incomplete core results, and confirms that only the
enrolled public snapshot crosses the bridge. Both trials use **synthetic core/model
replies**, not real inference or peer execution. Focused checks additionally cover
adapter, editor and lifecycle behavior. The complete model-driven OpenCode
read/edit/test loop, native editor UI operation, protected peer execution and a
finished immune-policy path remain unproved.

**Real public peer proof:** a separate owner command successfully obtained a
small single-file replacement from a real Qwen0.6B worker on another peer.
After explicit edit and check approvals, the unchanged original tests and an
independent check passed. The original
[disposable-network trial](https://github.com/VOLPAROSSA/volparossa-code/actions/runs/37221727043)
also passed its discovery/task route checks and complete cleanup. This proves
that bounded public operation, not a native OpenCode planning loop, general
coding quality or confidential execution of private source on other devices.

The available conversation executor is still **private and local**. Its scope is
shown honestly; the adapter does not disguise it as network compute or export
private input through the public peer interface.

**VOLPAROSSA: Run OpenCode Task with Enrolled Public Work** additionally connects
one explicitly reviewed public question and selected excerpt to the core's
cooperative task interface. The model can invoke this task once; it cannot append
private files or history to it. A limited owner-side proxy keeps the raw public
core socket outside the coding sandbox. Core owns peer placement, execution and
cancellation; original task results and incomplete-answer flags are retained.
This interface requires a core that implements the matching cooperative-compute
contract. Complete joined answers through the real OpenCode tool remain unproved.

**Run OpenCode Task with Enrolled Public Source** instead enrolls the complete
saved source file for a peer-generated code replacement. The native agent can
request that original proposal through the same single-use tool, then propose
local changes and run separately approved checks. This connects the code-purpose
service to the agent loop; a complete real-model cooperative coding run remains
to be proved. See [public source tasks](docs/OPENCODE.md#explicit-public-single-file-proposals-candidate).

This public-only development step is **not** the intended limit of cooperation:
default collaboration, shared learning and protected private execution across
the network remain required functionality.

The existing **Ask About Selected Code (Private, Local)** and **Show Compute
Capabilities** commands remain available. Selected-code advice sends only the
confirmed question and excerpt to the same-owner core socket. It does not change
files or execute tools. The direct Q&A interface allows **512 UTF-8 bytes for the
question and 4096 for the selection**, subject to the selected model's smaller
token budget. Oversized input is refused, not silently shortened; partial output
and uncertain cancellation or cleanup are not presented as success.

The separate [real core/model Q&A trial](https://github.com/VOLPAROSSA/volparossa/actions/runs/36738995292)
passes with the pinned private client and 360M model, including cancellation,
isolation and cleanup checks. That remains evidence for the direct Q&A adapter,
not the OpenCode read/edit/test loop, native editor UI or general coding quality.

## Development setup

See [OpenCode setup, isolation and proof boundaries](docs/OPENCODE.md).
Use a trusted local workspace and explicitly provision the pinned runtime and
core/model service. Opening the extension or a project starts no model, runtime
or network participation. No OpenAI login or automatic cloud fallback is used.

Run focused checks with Node 22 or newer:

```sh
node --test tests/opencode-*.test.cjs tests/cooperative-*.test.cjs tests/chat-completions-provider.test.cjs tests/extension.test.cjs
```

Original integration code is GPL-3.0-only. OpenCode is MIT-licensed; its original
notice and source pin are preserved in [third-party provenance](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

## Remaining work

- Exercise the source-built OpenCode runtime with actual core inference and a
  model-driven read/edit/test task with explicit local approvals and independently
  checked results, then verify native editor operation.
- Extend the proven public single-file owner command to a complete real-model
  OpenCode cooperative tool loop; retain original results, cancellation and provenance.
- Implement remote conversation execution and actual protected private work,
  with suitable model capacity, measured performance and core-owned resource
  accounting. Public sharing is not a substitute for private execution.
- Join immune-policy admission, result review and approved shared learning to
  those paths; local approval dialogs alone do not provide that system.
- Reuse suitable upstream clients on additional platforms and package verified
  integrations without silently downloading runtimes or changing host settings.

Earlier [Codex runtime](docs/RUNTIME_BUILD.md), [Responses adapter](docs/RESPONSES_PROVIDER.md)
and [native-editor](docs/NATIVE_EDITOR.md) records remain **historical evidence**.
Their checks do not prove OpenCode operation. Small provisioned models do not
establish competitive coding quality or the capacity of the eventual shared brain.
